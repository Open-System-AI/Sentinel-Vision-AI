## Introduction

Sentinel-Vision-AI is designed to serve as a powerful tool for applications that require real-time image analysis. This project combines the power of deep learning models with a user-friendly API that integrates seamlessly with mobile applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Image Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide real-time analysis of images.
- **API Integration**: Connects with mobile applications through a robust API, allowing for smooth operation and easy access to model predictions.
- **Modular Design**: The project is modular, making it easy to update models and improve functionality.
- **Easy Deployment**: Designed for easy deployment on various platforms, including cloud services.

## Installation

To get started with Sentinel-Vision-AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Open-System-AI/Sentinel-Vision-AI.git
   cd Sentinel-Vision-AI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file and configure it with your environment variables, such as API keys, database URLs, etc.

## Usage

### Running the API Server

Start the API server by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:5000/`. You can now send requests to the API for image analysis.

### Mobile Application Integration

The API can be integrated with a mobile application by making HTTP requests to the provided endpoints. Make sure your mobile app is set up to handle these requests and process the returned data appropriately.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /predict**: Accepts an image file and returns the model's prediction.
- **GET /status**: Returns the status of the API, including the model's current state and available resources.

Example request for prediction:

```bash
curl -X POST -F 'image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg' http://localhost:5000/predict
```

## Model Training

If you want to train your own models, you can follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Organize your dataset into the appropriate directories (train, validate, test).

2. **Configure the Model**: Edit the configuration files located in the `config/` directory to suit your model architecture and training preferences.

3. **Start Training**:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config/model_config.yaml
   ```

4. **Export Weights**: Once training is complete, export the model weights for use with the API.
